
## Cold Start Misfire
- Intake Manifold Gasket leak (could close up due to heat)
    - Brake Cleaner on manifold on start
- minimal coolant seapage into a cylinder -> Doubt because first 10 seconds run fine. + recent rebuild -> but could have happend because of overpressure of coolant
- Cabron buildup on Spark Plugs or gap out of spec
- Choke not closing properly
- Distributor rebuilding -> youtube video

### Gameplan
1) brake cleaner on intake gasket + Carb rubbers
2) clean and gap sparkplugs
3) Adjust Choke
4) Make car leaner -> MARK CURRENT FUEL SETTING
5) Rebuild Distributor
6) Buy a boroscope and check for coolant seapage into cylinders
