
## Cold Start Misfire
- Intake Manifold Gasket leak (could close up due to heat)
    - Brake Cleaner on manifold on start
- minimal coolant seapage into a cylinder -> Doubt because first 10 seconds run fine. + recent rebuild -> but could have happend because of overpressure of coolant
- Choke not closing properly
- Distributor rebuilding -> youtube video

### Gameplan
1) brake cleaner on intake gasket + Carb rubbers -> X
2) clean and gap sparkplugs -> X
3) after 12 hours -> add oil then start, see if clunking goes away (i suspect oil pressure to come on too late)
4) Adjust Choke
5) Make car leaner -> MARK CURRENT FUEL SETTING
6) Rebuild Distributor
7) Buy a boroscope and check for coolant seapage into cylinders (cylinder 3 had minor  oil around the seal?)
